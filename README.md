Have you used grappling hooks in VR before
1Yes 
2no
3Yes
4no
5no

How did the grapple hook work / how do you expect it to work

2Probably like AA sceptical on how to aim it
3Like AB
4Like CA
6 probably like AA

Do you think that grappling hooks are a sensible thing to add to VR apps as a way to get around
1As swinging possibly but motion sickness may be a problem
2No
3Yeah, lower motion sickness than other options
4yeah
5no



Which interaction do you believe would be the most reasonable for moving around a lobby 
1Yes with the AA and with anothe interaction similar to CA
2CA or AA
3AA 
4AA or CA
5AA

Do you believe different ways to use grappling hooks should be explored farther
1It could be fun but not useful 
2Yeah, any make believe interaction are useful
3Yeah
4Yeah rare seems cool
5no

Do you feel like grapple hooks cause too much motion sickness to be used as a main way of movement in an expirience
1Surprisingly low motion sickness because lack of rotation
2Yes it could be a problem
3Yes but not with these
4Yeah not for him
5yes probably

I made a few different ways to throw a grapple hook and a few ways for the grapple hook to function too. From what I saw everyone really liked the first grapple hook but the second was lame. They all really liked to control where the grapple went. They also liked the third way to throw out the grapple but more as a concept, it made them think about how different grapples could work but they seemed to be just ok with it in practice.
